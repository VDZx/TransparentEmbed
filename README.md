TransparentEmbed allows you to invisibly hide (encrypted) data in the RGB values of transparent pixels of images with transparency. You can then use TransparentExtract to extract this data again. CountTransparent lets you check how much data can be stored in an image.

# Usage

## General

The .exe files can be used as .NET libraries if you want to integrate them into another program. (You can rename them to .dll or just add them directly as .exe references.) All relevant functions should be exported.

## TransparentEmbed

TransparentEmbed.exe [options] \<inputFile\> \<fileToEmbed\> \<outputFile\>

The following options are supported:

* -k [key], --key [key]: Use the specified encryption key
* -c [type], --content [type]: Specify content type: 'file', 'text' or 'data'
* -t [number], --threshold [number]: Maximum alpha for data pixels (0 by default)
* -o [offset], --offset [offset]: Offset in fileToEmbed to start reading at (0 by default)
* -l [bytes], --length [bytes]: Number of bytes in fileToEmbed to read; use 0 to read everything (0 by default)
* -v, --verbose: Print verbose output
* -s, --silent: Do not print any output (will still print output if invalid arguments are provided, but not on error)

If no key is specified, the key 'SecureBeneathTheWatchfulEyes' will be used by default. Explicitly specify an empty key ("") if you want to embed the data unencrypted.

It should go without saying that if you don't want anyone stumbling upon the image to be able to extract the contents, you should specify a custom key rather than using the default.

## TransparentExtract

Usage: TransparentExtract.exe [options] \<inputFile\> [outputFile]

The following options are supported:

* -k [key], --key [key]: Use the specified encryption key
* -t [number], --threshold [number]: Maximum alpha for data pixels (0 by default)
* -a [inputFile], --append [inputFile]: Also extract another file and append it to the result (can be repeated)
* -p, --print: Display the embedded text instead of writing to a file
* -v, --verbose: Print verbose output
* -s, --silent: Do not print any output other than --print output (will still print output if invalid arguments are provided, but not on error)

If no key is specified, the key 'SecureBeneathTheWatchfulEyes' will be used by default. Explicitly specify an empty key ("") if you want to extract unencrypted data.

## CountTransparent

Usage: CountTransparent.exe [options] \<inputFile\>

Only the threshold option is supported:

* -t [number], --threshold [number]: Maximum alpha for data pixels (0 by default)

# How it works and format spec

Each pixel consists of four byte values: red, green, blue and alpha. The latter determines the degree of transparency, with 255 being not at all transparent and 0 being fully transparent. Even fully transparent pixels have RGB values, so we use them to store data without affecting the image visually. (Using the threshold option you can also embed data into slightly transparent pixels, but this will be very subtly visible in the image; by default it only uses fully transparent pixels.) They are encoded left to right, top to bottom starting at the top left, skipping all non-transparent (or insufficiently transparent if threshold > 0) pixels.

Unless an empty key is explicitly specified, the data will be encrypted using AES256. The first 16 bytes of the data will be the IV. After that follows encrypted data. It starts with the header:

* (1 byte) Format version, currently 0x01
* (1 byte) Content type:
* * 0x00 - Invalid
* * 0x01 - Data
* * 0x02 - File
* * 0x03 - Text
* (4 bytes) Length of (compressed) data
* (16 bytes) MD5 hash of (compressed) data

Beyond that is the data, with compressed length as specified in the header, compressed using the DEFLATE algorithm. It may be (and is by default) followed by unencrypted random data. If an empty key is used, the IV is skipped and the embeded data starts immediately with the format version. It is otherwise identical, save for being unencrypted.

## Encryption details

The encryption used is AES256 with a randomly generated IV (16 bytes), which is prepended to the encrypted data. The key used for the encryption is derived from the user-provided key (or 'SecureBeneathTheWatchfulEyes' if none is provided), hashed using the PBKDF2 algorithm with 4854 cycles using the salt 41726775696e67207468617420796f7520646f6e277420636172652061626f75742074686520726967687420746f2070726976616379206265636175736520796f752068617665206e6f7468696e6720746f2068696465206973206e6f20646966666572656e74207468616e20736179696e6720796f7520646f6e277420636172652061626f7574206672656520737065656368206265636175736520796f752068617665206e6f7468696e6720746f207361792e ('Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.'). Note that data beyond the indicated length may (and likely will) be random and whatever function you use for decryption might break if you read beyond the encrypted data.

* It was embedded by running: TransparentEmbed.exe "laughing mahiro.png" embeddingtools.zip output.png
* It can be extracted by running: TransparentExtract.exe input.png output.zip

If you have more data than you can fit in an image, you can split it over multiple images:
